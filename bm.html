<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<h2>What is this game?</h2>

<p>A fantasy realm is being simulated. Something like a town with some
  territories around it. You represent a higher being, a king or maybe a god,
  and your task is to indirectly control your kingdom by placing orders.
  Your people will try and fulfill your orders to their limits, hopefully in
  hilarious ways, with some fatalities maybe.</p>

<p>Placing bounties (if i decide to go with the king idea, but that is less funny),
  giving orders, doing divine things, blessing or cursing heroes/enemies etc.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Art and models: Self made, lowpoly or 3D voxel.</li>
  <li>Engine: UE4 or C++/OGRE.</li>
  <li>AI: Goal Oriented Action Planning.</li>
</ul>

<h3>World</h3>

<p>Randomly generated 3D or voxel 3D.</p>

<h3>UI/Controls</h3>

<p>Mobile-friendly, touch-friendly, mouse-friendly, keyboard not-so-friendly
  but with mouse &mdash; friendly too.
  Context-dependent UI hints everywhere.</p>

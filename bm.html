<h2>What is this game?</h2>

<p>This is a 3D world step-by-step simulation game, where you organize a
  settlement, give orders and see them being done. Sometimes done in disastrous
  or hilarious ways. Things will die, in strange ways. Settlement may be damaged
  or destroyed. Eventually you will lose, but I hope that you will have a lot of
  fun in the process.</p>

<h2>Play Style</h2>

<p>Player's control over the world and the settlers is limited. Player can give
  commands, WHAT he wants changed in the world. It is quite possible
  that certain order will never be picked up for execution &mdash; no tools,
  no materials or just all remaining settlers are unable to do it, like having
  no hands, being in combat or dead.</p>

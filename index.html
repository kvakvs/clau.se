<h3>{{ page.title }}</h3>

<p>My name is Dmytro, and I am a software engineer. You can find me
    on FB, Twitter, Github etc. using the same nickname.</p>

<h3>My current projects</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="bm.html">Bearded Men</a></strong>
        &mdash; an attempt to create simulation game in my
        free time. Different approaches have been tried, including
        <a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/BeardedMen">Qt+OpenGL raw C++</a>,
        using <a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/BeardedMenUE">Unreal Engine</a>
        and Unity (no URL yet). So far both Qt+OpenGL and Unity look promising.</li>

    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/otp/tree/cmake">CMake build
        system</a> for Erlang/OTP</strong> &mdash; an attempt to rewrite
        and replace bunch of convoluted Makefiles and use CMake to build and
        release Erlang/OTP.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Previous projects: frozen, paused or abandoned</h3>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/eia">Erlang in Anger</a> &mdash; Russian translation.
    Requires some proof reading and editing which possibly will never be done.</li>
    
    <li><a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/gluonvm">Gluon Erlang VM</a> &mdash; a BEAM-compatible
    virtual machine for Erlang written in C++. Floating somewhere close to proof of concept stage.
    It mostly works, but has few features.</li>
    
    <li><a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/erlang-handbook">Erlang Handbook</a> &mdash; an
    outdated translation of Erlang Handbook to Russian. Mostly usable.</li>
    
    <li><a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/hge">HGE, Haaf's Graphics Engine</a> &mdash; a Windows
    game engine written in simple C++ supporting DirectX 8 and 9. Passive support and maintenance
    mode, also hosting <a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/hge">Dummy Website</a> and 
    a <a href="http://kvakvs.github.io/hge/doc/index.html">clone of original website</a> for HGE.</li>
    
    <li><a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/tx">Term Explorer for Erlang</a> &mdash; a simple
    self-dependent Erlang library, which spawns a web page to pretty-print long nested terms with
    type highlighting and limited live process inspection features.</li>
    
    <li><a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/macaba">Macaba Imageboard</a> &mdash; an old (and 
    potentially very slow under load) image board implementation in Erlang and Riak. If I was rewriting
    it today, I'd use memory-only or disk_copies Mnesia for posts and comments, while storing image
    files on either mechanical hard drives or SSD with standard OS caching layer.</li>
</ul>

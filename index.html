<h3>{{ page.title }}</h3>

<p>My name is Dmytro, and I am a software engineer. You can find me
    on FB, Twitter, Github etc. using the same nickname.</p>

<h3>My current projects</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Bearded Men</strong> &mdash; an attempt to create simulation game in my
    free time. Different approaches have been tried, including
        <a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/BeardedMen">Qt+OpenGL raw C++</a>,
        using <a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/BeardedMenUE">Unreal Engine</a>
        and Unity (no URL yet). So far both Qt+OpenGL and Unity look promising.</li>

    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/otp/tree/cmake">CMake build
        system</a> for Erlang/OTP</strong> &mdash; and attempt to rewrite
        and replace bunch of convoluted Makefiles and use CMake to build and
        release Erlang/OTP.</li>
</ul>

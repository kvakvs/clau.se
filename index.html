<h3>{{ page.title }}</h3>

<p>My name is Dmytro, and I am a software engineer. You can find me
  on FB, Twitter,
  <a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/">Github</a>
  etc. using the same nickname.</p>

<h3>My current projects</h3>

<p>Updated: 17 Oct 2016</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="bm.html">Bearded Men</a> Simulation Game.</strong>
    A game about higher being (a king, or a god maybe) indirectly
    controlling a realm, inhabited by small beings with their own will.
    Sort of like Dwarf Fortress, but friendlier to the player.
    <strong>Now the game is at design concept stage.</strong></li>

  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/beam_bots">BEAM Bots</a></strong>
    &mdash; A robot game, where you connect to the game via ZeroMQ API and can
    spawn then control a toy car. Multiplayer. Physics. 3D render.
    Unreal Engine 4.</li>

  <li>A Russian translation for
    <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024149.do">the "Scalability"</a>
    book on behalf of DMK Press.</li>

  <li><strong><a href="http://beam-wisdoms.clau.se">BEAM Wisdoms</a></strong>
    &mdash; A collection of easy to read and in-depth articles on BEAM VM
    which runs Erlang, Elixir and other languages.
  </li>

</ul>

<h3>Previous Finished/Paused</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="bm-old.html">Bearded Men (previous)</a></strong>
    &mdash; an attempt to create simulation game in my
    free time. Different approaches have been tried, including
    <a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/BeardedMen">Qt+OpenGL raw C++</a>,
    using <a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/BeardedMenUE">Unreal Engine</a>
    and Unity (no URL yet). Project concept now changed to BM Sim
    (see in the projects above).
  </li>

  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/otp/tree/cmake">CMake build
    system</a> for Erlang/OTP</strong> &mdash; an attempt to rewrite
    and replace bunch of convoluted Makefiles and use CMake to build and
    release Erlang/OTP.
  </li>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/eia">Erlang in Anger</a> &mdash;
    Russian translation. Requires some proof reading and editing which possibly
    will never be done.
  </li>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/gluonvm">Gluon Erlang VM</a> &mdash; a
    BEAM-compatible virtual machine for Erlang written in C++. It is somewhere
    nearing the proof of concept stage, but then the concept changed.
    Almost works, was able to run small simple scripts but never booted to
    Erlang shell.
  </li>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/erlang-handbook">Erlang
    Handbook</a> &mdash; an outdated translation of Erlang Handbook to Russian.
    Mostly usable.
  </li>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/hge">HGE, Haaf's Graphics
    Engine</a> &mdash; a Windows game engine written in simple C++ supporting
    DirectX 8 and 9. Passive support and maintenance
    mode, also hosting <a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/hge">Dummy Website</a>
    and a <a href="http://kvakvs.github.io/hge/doc/index.html">clone of original
    website</a> for HGE.
  </li>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/tx">Term Explorer for
    Erlang</a> &mdash; a simple self-dependent Erlang library, which spawns a web
    page to pretty-print long nested terms with
    type highlighting and limited live process inspection features.
  </li>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/kvakvs/macaba">Macaba Imageboard</a> &mdash;
    an old (and potentially very slow under load) image board implementation
    in Erlang and Riak. If I was rewriting it today, I'd use memory-only or
    disk_copies Mnesia for posts and comments, while storing image
    files on either mechanical hard drives or SSD with standard OS caching
    layer.
  </li>
</ul>

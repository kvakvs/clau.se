<h3>General facts</h3>

<ul>

    <li>Beasts: small, medium, large, very large. Some tameable. Many edible.</li>

    <li>Availability of magic: [None, Rare, Common] - this affects how many
    races and creatures will have magical abilities.</li>

    <li>Minerals: ...</li>
    <li>Liquids: ...</li>
    <li>Tool and weapon craft: stone, wood, metal etc</li>

    <li>Flow of time: 1 game iteration equals to 2 hours. 12 iterations - 1 day,
        ~360 iterations - a month, ~4300 iterations - a year.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technology</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Swords, maces, polearms, daggers</li>
    <li>Simple mining and crafting tools (stone, wood, metal+)</li>
    <li>Archery, limited gun models</li>
    <li>Simple humin-sized mechanisms</li>
    <li>Large mechanisms (drawbridges etc) require some power, river power maybe.</li>
    <li>Brick-laying, digging, carving - that sort of building is available.</li>
    <li>Agriculture: growing grains, normal and root vegetables, vines, shrooms.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Professions and skills</h3>

<p>Every character can take any skill. Affinities give bonus to few certain
    random skill, but that just saves time while training. A skill that is not
    used for 6-12+ months is losing points (rusts). Higher complexity crafts take
    increasingly more time and materials with low skill.</p>

<h4>Military skills</h4>

    <li>Archer</li>
    <li>Gunner</li>
    <li>One-handed weapons</li>
    <li>Two-handed weapons</li>
    <li>Trapper (both enemy and animals)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Peaceful skills</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Miner</li>
    <li>Smith</li>
    <li>Carpenter/woodworker</li>
    <li>Cook</li>
    <li>Stonemason</li>
    <li>Medic</li>
    <li>Militia/enforcer</li>
    <li>Farmer (both animals and plants). Things to consider: some people,
    me included, would like to minimize farming. And some other people enjoy it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Management</h3>

<p>Player's control over the world is limited. Player can give commands, WHAT
    he wants changed in the world. Characters select orders that they prefer and
    try to build a plan, how to do the change.</p>
<p>Example of desired changes: mining (want this block be not solid),
    want a ramp, want to produce N of item M.
    Example of characters' own desires: Hungry (want to increase satiety),
    sleepy (want to increase rested), bored (want to increase entertained).</p>

<ul>
    <li>Define zones for storage (select what goes where), for sleep, for
    partying and eating, for farming.</li>
</ul>
